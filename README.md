# ChordNetworkAnalysis
A simple Chord-like network analysis application. Mid-Term of the Peer To Peer and Blockchains course at the university of Pisa, academic year 2017/2018.

The goal is to write a simple Chord network in order to perform some static network analysis with some tools such as [Cytoscape](http://www.cytoscape.org/index.html) , and some analysis after issuing a certain number of queries.
The network is static, no churn is considered and thus the join/leave methods are not implemented. 

For the purposes of the mid-term the network isn't distributed but the queries are managed by a Coordinator.
